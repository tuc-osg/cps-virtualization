# Device Virtualization for Mobile Heterogeneous Cyber-Physical Systems

Prototypical implementations for a research project on providing sensor and actuator virtualization for mobile heterogeneous cyber-physical systems (CPS).

This project currently comprises implementations for
- a model of an application and runtime-environment which enable the developers to take a physical perspective on CPS (app-rte), as well as
- a physical world model which, in the future, can be used for validating applications during the development process and predicting outcomes of device actions during the execution of the application (physical-world).
